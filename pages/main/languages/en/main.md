Notes:
- The World Size and Resource Amount are available only to people with advanced world settings. if you do not have advanced world settings, the default for both is 100%.
- Choose the resource and it will calculate the maximum amount of that resource at the Resource column.
- When filtering a raw resource, it gets calculated from that raw resource's column. Other resources get calculated from all the resources.
